1. Make the board somehow "modular" allow more components to be attached to it, i.e SD Cards
2. Fast DAC and AAC maybe somehow use that
3. Potential file system intefration
4. The board has a whole other chip on it that can preform operations in the DSP realm, and others,
communication between these chips?
5. Try to get this board communicating with another board, ie a board running a linux kernal could
be easy with a Rasberry PI.
6. look at the zbus (a bus where multiple threads can talk to one another)
