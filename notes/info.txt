THE DEVICE TREE

- the purpose is to define the structure of the layout of the hardware ex below -->

/ { // <-- this is the root node, devices tree must always start here

      soc { // <-- a node that is supposed to represenent the SOC chip.

          // within any particular node you can have node "children" here is soc has a child
          // i2c-bus-controller

          i2c-bus-controller {

              i2c-peripheral-1 {

              };

              i2c-peripheral-2 {

              };
          };
      };
};


- nodes can also be defined with values within them like this -->

/ {
    node {
        foo = <1> // here the node foo now has a property 1 within it
                  // there is a very helpful guide here to defining different kinds of varibales:
                  // https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/build/dts/intro-syntax-structure.html#dt-writing-property-values
    };
};

- another interesting feature is the ability to set certain devices within the address space of
  another device using the @ symbol

/ {
    soc {
        i2c-bus@3000 { // here we are setting the i2c bus to be at a certain address within the
                       // address space of its parent so i2c-bus is at address 0x3000 within its
                       // parent soc

        };
    };
};
