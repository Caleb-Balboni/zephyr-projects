OVERVIEW

The Zephyr zbus provides a completed implementation of thread safe intercommunication. With the zbus
system you can have multiple channels (with their own messaging system) which will have listeners,
observers and subscribers.

Listeners, a callback that the event dispatcher executes every time an observed channel is published or notified

Async Listeners, a callback that the event dispatcher schedules to execute in a work queue (system work queue by default)
every time an observed channel is published or notified

Subscriber, a thread-based observer that relies internally on a message queue where the event dispatcher puts a changed channel’s
reference every time an observed channel is published or notified. Note this kind of observer does not receive the message itself.
It should read the message from the channel after receiving the notification
(this would be especially interesting for the spi implementation later, as this would fit perfectly
for the transaction of data)

Message subscribers, a thread-based observer that relies internally on a FIFO where the event dispatcher puts a copy of
the message every time an observed channel is published or notified.


DATA SHARIING OPTIONS

There are two ways that data can be shared in this messaging system.

The first is the message itself, which is a user defined struct. This is obviously helpful as we can essentially pass any
type of information as long as the reciever knows how to correctly cast the data.

The second is a 'user data' structure that is held internally within the channel itself, the
modification of this structure will affect all other recievers as this is a shared data structure,
and is meant to hold info about the channel itself.
