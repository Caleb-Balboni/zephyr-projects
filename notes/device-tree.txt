THE DEVICE TREE


GENERAL STRUCTURE:

  - formatted in heirarchical structure of parent and children nodes (somewhat like a json file)

  - node { // name of the node comes first
           // contents are within the brackets
    };     // end with a semi-colon

  EXAMPLE:
  / { // <-- this is the root node, devices tree must always start here

        soc { // <-- a node that is supposed to represenent the SOC chip.

            // within any particular node you can have node "children" here is soc has a child
            // i2c-bus-controller

            i2c-bus-controller {

              i2c-peripheral-1 {

              };

              i2c-peripheral-2 {

              };
          };
      };
  };

ATTRIBUTES:

  - within a node there can be attributes, some of these are predefined keywords, others can be
    defined by the dev
  - attribute definition follow a "C" like standard generall <name> = <attribute> the type of the
    attribute is defined by the below syntax

      IMPORTANT ATTRIBUTES:
        - string: a-string = "hello, world";
        - int: a-int = <1>
        - boolean: a-boolean; <-- this one is weird, if its defined than its true, else its not
        - array: a-array = <1 2 3 4 5>


ADDRESS SPACE REFRENCING:
  - for some by placing an @ follow by an address you can specify the location in physicaly memory
    of the child node within its parent node (for example an i2c device on an i2c controller)

/ {
    soc {
        i2c-bus@3000 { // here we are setting the i2c bus to be at a certain address within the
                       // address space of its parent so i2c-bus is at address 0x3000 within its
                       // parent soc

        };
    };
};
